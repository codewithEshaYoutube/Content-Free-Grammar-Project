# Content Free Grammar Project

## Project Overview

The **Content Free Grammar Project** is a tool designed to provide real-time grammar correction based on fundamental grammar rules. This project uses AI-driven models to suggest grammar improvements, helping users refine their writing. It is aimed at educational, personal, and non-commercial use, providing a simple yet effective way to enhance text quality.

### Project Concept

This project focuses on automating grammar correction through an intuitive web interface. It analyzes input text for grammatical errors and provides suggestions for improvements. The core objective is to create a resource for individuals who wish to improve their writing skills, particularly students and educators. By leveraging basic grammar rules, it provides quick, real-time feedback for common grammar mistakes.

### Relevance to Theory of Automata

This project is closely related to the **Theory of Automata** as part of the 5th-semester curriculum. The grammar correction engine is built around the principles of formal languages and automata theory, specifically focusing on the parsing and analysis of text based on context-free grammars (CFG). The project demonstrates the practical application of automata theory by implementing algorithms that simulate the behavior of finite state machines and context-free grammars for text analysis and correction.
